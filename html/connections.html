  <h1 class="superTitle">What does The Book of Mormon Teach?</h1>

  <img class="jesuspic" src="../img/teech.jpeg" alt="teech">
  
  <p class="bodyText">
    The purpose of the Book of Mormon is to teach about Jesus Christ and His gospel.
    It is a book of scripture similar to the Bible. 
    It was found and translated by Joseph Smith, who translated it through the power of God. 
    The Book of Mormon contains the teachings of many prophets, helping us to better understand the doctrine 
    of Christ. <em>In this page, I have included the full video produced by The Church of Jesus
    Christ of Latter Day Saints for each of my favorite  
    lessons in the Book of Mormon. Below each video I have included a short summary 
    of what the video contains.</em>

    This video shows Lehi's last interactions with his children and grandchildren

    understand why we are here on earth, what our purpose is, and what happens after
    we die. Knowing the answers to these questions helps put our life in perspective
    and help us feel more secure.
