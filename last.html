  <h1 class="superTitle">What does The Book of Mormon Teach?</h1>

  <p class="bodyText">
    I'll end this blog by giving my personal thoughts on the Book of Mormon and 
    why I think we need it today.

  <h2 class="sectionTitle">Why We Need the Book of Mormon Today</h2>
  
  <p class="bodyText"> 
    We live in a time where less people die than ever before in history,
    we have access to such advanced technology that it would seem
    like magic to those who lived even 200 years ago, and we such widespread
    communication that it is possible to talk to someone on the other side of the world
    instantly and easily. Despite these great wonders, most people would agree that the world 
    seems to be getting darker. 
    There are still wars and sicknesses that cna drive our planet to a halt. 
    I believe that these are signs of Christ's imminent return. 
    The Book of Mormon came to teach people about Jesus, and prepare people to 
    receive Him at His second coming. The Book of Mormon helps us learn about him
    and instructs us on how to live so that we can be prepared. 
    We have the Book of Mormon today to help us learn about Him and follow His example.

  <h2 class="sectionTitle">My Thoughts on The Book of Mormon and Jesus Christ</h2>
  
  <p class="bodyText"> 
    Frankly, I love it. It has helped me realize that God loves me 
    during some of the most difficult times in my life. Through its teachings,
    I have learned that I am never really alone, that God is with me and supporting
    me through all of my trials. Because of it, I have learned about God's plan 
    for me, and I know what my purpose in living is. Through it, I have learned 
    about Jesus Christ, the greatest man to ever live. I learned that He went 
    through the worst pain that is possible to experience, and that only He could
    have supported it. I know that He has experienced my pain, and that He is there 
    to pick me up when I fall. I know that because of Him, I do not need to worry 
    or fear, because He has already won the war, and I just need to join His side.
    Because of Jesus Christ I can be happy, even when I mess up and fail. Thinking of 
    Him gives me the strength to keep going when its hard, and to never give up.
    Focusing on Him give me clarity and puts everything in perspective. 
    Jesus Christ is my personal Savior, and He has never failed me. 
    I love Jesus Christ. I love The Book of Mormon because it taught me about 
    Him. If you haven't read it, I would recommend you <span><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng">give it a try.</a></span>
    See if you can learn about Him like I did. I can promise you won't regret it.
