  <h1 class="superTitle">What Is The Story of The Book of Mormon?</h1>

  <p class="bodyText">
    The Book of Mormon was written by Native Americans who were originally from Israel, specifically Jerusalem shortly before its destruction in 586 BC. 
    It starts with the life of the prophet Lehi. He attempted to warn the people of
    Jerusalem to repent so the city could be saved, but they quickly rejected him. 
    He was then instructed by God to leave Jerusalem with his family. They left all of their 
    belongings and traveled through the wilderness.

  <p class="bodyText">
    Lehi had four sons, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. Laman and Lemuel were
    his oldest sons, followed by Sam, then Nephi. Laman and Lemuel were slow in 
    listening to their father, but Nephi recognized that Lehi was a prophet and 
    did his best to follow his father's instructions. Nephi eventually became a prophet like 
    his father, but Laman and Lemuel thought they deserved to lead their family.
  </p>

  <p class="bodyText">
    Lehi's family eventually traveled to the ocean and built a boat and traveled to the 
    American continent. When they arrived, they split into two opposing
    nations, the Nephites and the Lamanites, named after Lehi's sons. These nations
    quickly became enemies, and spent the majority of their time attempting to destroy each other.

  <p class="bodyText">
    A large part of The Book of Mormon documents the wars between the Lamanite and Nephite
    tribes. They hated each other for their difference in beliefs. The Nephites
    believed in God and the Lamanites did not. The Lamanites also believed 
    that the Nephites had stolen the right to lead from their ancestors. Their wars 
    generally consisted of the Lamanites attacking the Nephites for supposed 
    wrongdoing. The Nephites were promised that as long as they remained faithful
    to God, they would be victorious over the Lamanites. 
  </p>

  <img class="jesuspic" src="../img/bapt.jpeg" alt="Baptism image">

  <p class="bodyText">
    The wars and fighting were sometimes mitigated by Nephite missionaries teaching
    the Lamanites about God and His mercy, and baptizing them as they agreed to give
    up their hatred.
  </p>

  <p class="bodyText">
    The greatest era of peace between these two peoples came after Jesus Christ himself
    appeared to them. As He said in <span><a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-10-16/">John 10:16</a></span>
    "other sheep I have, which are not of this fold." Jesus told his disciples
    that others would hear his voice, and some of these people were the Nephites and
    Lamanites.  
  </p>

  <img class="jesuspic" src="../img/jesusteach.jpeg" alt="mo jesus">

  <p class="bodyText">
    Jesus taught these people His law, instructed them to abolish contention, and
    healed their sick and afflicted. The Nephites and Lamanites united as one people 
    and followed Christ's teachings in an era of peace that lasted around 200 years.
  </p>

  <p class="bodyText">
    Sadly, the peaceful times Jesus brought were not to last, and two centuries 
    after Christ's visit, the Lamanites and Nephites began to hate each other once again.
    They began killing each other and as more and more Nephites fell away from God 
    and defected to the Lamanites, the Nephites were razed from the earth.

    The last Nephite general was named Mormon. He and his son Moroni were the only 
    Nephites to remain faithful to God at the end of the Nephite civilization. 
    He compiled and summarized the works of the previous Nephite prophets into a single, cohesive 
    work, and it is for this reason that The Book of Mormon has its name. Mormon
    was killed alongside his people when the Nephites were eradicated. 
  </p>

  <p class="bodyText">
    The only Nephite not killed in their extinction was Moroni, the son of Mormon.
    After seeing all of his people killed, he wrote his final thoughts and testimony, completing he Book of Mormon. 
  </p>

  <img class="jesuspic" src="../img/plates.jpeg" alt="plates">

  <p class="bodyText">
    Moroni traveled to what would later be NeW York and buried the completed Book of Mormon.
    It would be found and translated over a thousand years later by Joseph Smith.

  <p class="bodyText">
    While it contains tragic elements, The Book of Mormon's primary purpose is not merely to recount history, but to testify of Christ. It exists to bring people closer to Jesus Christ and contains many of His teachings.
     Learning more about Him is the reason The Book of Mormon was written, and its climax is His 
    visit to Ancient America to preach His gospel, not the Nephite destruction.
