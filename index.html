        What is The Book of Mormon? It is a question that has been asked by many people. Some people 
        think that it is a book for cultists or pseudo-Christians. Others think that it is a series of 
        writings by a genius manipulator who deceived thousands of people into abandoning their
        homes and lives to follow him. It has been scrutinized by many since its publishing in 1829. 
        So what is it really? The Book of Mormon is a collection of books written by a culture of ancient 
        Native Americans that came here from Israel. It describes their experiences with God and Jesus Christ,
        their history, and their eventual destruction. It depicts their wars and peacemaking, their
        beliefs and activities, and even discusses the monetary system that they used. 
        It is an incredibly complex compilation of books, set up in a structure similar to The Bible.
        It is written with several different literary styles, including chiasmus.

        The Book of Mormon is a complex book. But what is its purpose? Why was it written, and who 
        was it written for? The purpose of The Book of Mormon, as written on the title page, is to help
        bring people closer to Jesus Christ, to understand His gospel, and to follow him. It was 
        written to help people feel His spirit, and to give a record of a visit that He had in the 
        Americas. It was literally written for us in modern times, and gives council that can be applied to 
        our day. It is an amazing book that everyone should read at least once in their life. 
        In this blog, I will discuss the general story of the Book of Mormon,
        how it connects to Jesus Christ and the bible, and how and why we should read and study it today.
